# CarbonOpus Contracts (`CarbonCoinLauncher`, `CarbonCoin`, & `CarbonOpus`)

This document provides context for interacting with the CarbonOpus smart contracts, specifically `CarbonCoinLauncher`, `CarbonCoin`, `CarbonOpus`, `CarbonCoinProtection`, `CarbonCoinConfig`, and `PermitAndTransfer`. It is intended for Dapp developers and as a reference for understanding the system's mechanics.

## 1. Overview

The CarbonOpus system is a two-part ecosystem for launching and trading new tokens (Artist Coins, not Meme Coins, these don't go to Zero quite so easily):

1.  **`CarbonCoinLauncher.sol`**: A factory contract that allows anyone to create their own `CarbonCoin` token for a small fee.
2.  **`CarbonCoin.sol`**: The token contract itself. Each token operates on a bonding curve for initial price discovery and trading. Once it gains enough traction (liquidity), it "graduates" by migrating its liquidity to a decentralized exchange (DEX).
3.  **`CarbonOpus.sol`**: An ERC-1155 NFT contract for minting and buying music.
4.  **`CarbonCoinDex.sol`**: A contract that provides deploying liquidity to a DEX upon graduation.
5.  **`CarbonCoinProtection.sol`**: A contract that provides various protection mechanisms for `CarbonCoin` tokens, including anti-bot, whale limits, and circuit breakers.
6.  **`CarbonCoinConfig.sol`**: A contract that stores default configurations for new `CarbonCoin` tokens.
7.  **`PermitAndTransfer.sol`**: A utility contract for performing EIP-2612 permit and transfer operations.

## 2. `CarbonCoinLauncher` - The Factory

The `CarbonCoinLauncher` is the entry point for creating new tokens.

### Key Purpose

-   To allow any user to deploy a new `CarbonCoin` token with a custom name, symbol, and bonding curve configuration.
-   To act as a registry for all tokens created through it.
-   To collect a fee for each token creation.

### Dapp Integration: Creating and Discovering Tokens

#### **Creating a Token**

A user can create a new token by calling the `createToken` function:

```solidity
function createToken(
  string memory name,
  string memory symbol,
  address creatorAddress,
  ICarbonCoin.BondingCurveConfig memory curveConfig
) public returns (address);
```

-   **Parameters:**
    -   `name`: The desired name of the token (e.g., "My Awesome Coin").
    -   `symbol`: The token's symbol (e.g., "MAC").
    -   `creatorAddress`: The address of the creator of the token.
    -   `curveConfig`: A struct defining the bonding curve's initial parameters:
        -   `virtualEth`: The virtual ETH reserve, which helps set the initial price.
        -   `virtualTokens`: The virtual token supply, also for setting the initial price.
        -   `maxSupply`: The total possible supply of the token.
        -   `graduationThreshold`: The amount of ETH reserves required in the bonding curve to trigger graduation to a DEX.
-   **Returns:** The address of the newly deployed `CarbonCoin` contract.

#### **Events**

To display a list of tokens and monitor launcher activities, a Dapp should listen for the following events:

-   `FeeReceived(address indexed sender, uint256 value, uint256 timestamp)`: Emitted when ETH is received by the launcher contract, typically as a creation fee.
-   `TokenCreated(address indexed tokenAddress, address indexed creator, string name, string symbol, uint256 createdAt)`: Emitted when a new `CarbonCoin` token is successfully created through the launcher.
    -   `tokenAddress`: The address of the newly created token contract.
    -   `creator`: The address of the user who created the token.
    -   `name`: The name of the new token.
    -   `symbol`: The symbol of the new token.
    -   `createdAt`: The timestamp of the token creation.
-   `MaxTokensPerCreatorUpdated(uint256 oldMax, uint256 newMax, uint256 timestamp)`: Emitted when the maximum number of tokens a single address can create is updated.
    -   `oldMax`: The previous maximum token count.
    -   `newMax`: The new maximum token count.
    -   `timestamp`: The timestamp of the update.
-   `ControllerUpdated(address newController)`: Emitted when the controller address of the launcher contract is updated.
    -   `newController`: The address of the new controller.
-   `LauncherPaused(uint256 timestamp)`: Emitted when the launcher contract is paused, preventing new token creations.
    -   `timestamp`: The timestamp of the pause.
-   `LauncherUnpaused(uint256 timestamp)`: Emitted when the launcher contract is unpaused, allowing new token creations.
    -   `timestamp`: The timestamp of the unpause.
-   `FeesWithdrawn(address indexed to, uint256 amount, uint256 timestamp)`: Emitted when collected fees are withdrawn from the contract.
    -   `to`: The address to which the fees were withdrawn.
    -   `amount`: The amount of fees withdrawn.
    -   `timestamp`: The timestamp of the withdrawal.
-   `TokenGraduated(address indexed tokenAddress, uint256 timestamp)`: Emitted when a token is marked as graduated by the launcher (usually called by the token itself).
    -   `tokenAddress`: The address of the token that graduated.
    -   `timestamp`: The timestamp of the graduation.

#### **Other Useful Functions**

-   `getStats()`: Returns platform-wide statistics like total tokens created and fees collected.
-   `tokens(address tokenAddress)`: Returns `TokenInfo` for a specific token.

## 3. `CarbonCoin` - The Token (USDC-based)

Each `CarbonCoin` contract has a two-phase lifecycle. This implementation uses USDC as the base currency for its bonding curve.

### Phase 1: Bonding Curve Trading (Pre-Graduation)

In this initial phase, all buying and selling occurs directly with the contract. The price is determined algorithmically by a bonding curve.

#### **Buying and Selling**

-   **To Buy:** A user calls `buy(uint256 usdcAmount, uint256 minTokensOut)` (or `buyWithPermit`) and approves USDC. The contract calculates the number of tokens they receive based on the current price and a buy fee. `minTokensOut` is a slippage parameter.
-   **To Sell:** A user first approves the contract to spend their tokens, then calls `sell(uint256 tokensIn, uint256 minUsdcOut)`. The contract calculates the USDC returned based on the current price and a sell fee. `minUsdcOut` is a slippage parameter.

#### **Price Calculations**

Your Dapp should use these view functions to estimate trades for users:

-   `getCurrentPrice()`: Returns the current instantaneous price of 1 token in USDC (with 6 decimals for USDC).
-   `calculateTokensOut(uint256 usdcIn)`: Calculates how many tokens a user will get for a given amount of USDC.
-   `calculateUsdcOut(uint256 tokensIn)`: Calculates how much USDC a user will get for selling a given amount of tokens.

#### **Built-in Protections (Important for Dapp UX)**

The contract has several protection mechanisms a Dapp must be aware of to provide a good user experience. These protections are largely managed by the `CarbonCoinProtection` contract.

**1. Anti-Bot Measures:**
-   Users have a cooldown period between buys (`getUserCooldown` via `CarbonCoinProtection`). Your UI should reflect this.
-   There are limits on buy amounts in the first few minutes after launch (`getAntiBotInfo` via `CarbonCoinConfig`).

**2. Whale Protection (Intent-to-Trade):**
Large trades (both buys and sells) that exceed the `whaleThreshold` require a two-step process to prevent price manipulation.

-   **Step 1: Register Intent:**
    -   The user attempts a large trade by calling `buy` or `sell`.
    -   The transaction will **revert** with a `WhaleIntentRequired` error. This is expected.
    -   The Dapp should catch this, and immediately call the **same function again** with the **same parameters**. This second call registers the user's "intent to trade" and will also revert, but this time with a `WhaleIntentNotReady` error.
-   **Step 2: Execute Trade:**
    -   The user must now wait for a cooldown period (`whaleDelay`). The Dapp can query `getWhaleIntent(address)` (on `CarbonCoinProtection`) to see the status and when the trade can be executed.
    -   After the delay, the user calls the **same `buy` or `sell` function a third time** with the exact same parameters. This will finally execute the trade.

Your Dapp's UI must guide the user through this "register, wait, execute" flow for large trades.

**3. Circuit Breaker:**
-   Trading can be automatically halted if the system detects extreme volatility or a high-impact trade.
-   Use `getCircuitBreakerStatus()` (on `CarbonCoinProtection`) to check if trading is paused and for how long. Your UI should disable trading and inform the user if the circuit breaker is active.

### Phase 2: Graduation & DEX Trading

When the contract's USDC balance (`realUsdcReserves`) reaches the `GRADUATION_THRESHOLD`, it automatically "graduates".

#### **What Happens During Graduation?**

1.  The `_graduate()` function is triggered.
2.  The `buy()` and `sell()` functions on the `CarbonCoin` contract are permanently disabled.
3.  The contract mints its remaining token supply.
4.  It takes all the USDC it holds and all the newly minted tokens and adds them as a liquidity pair on the designated DEX (e.g., Somnia Exchange) via `CarbonCoinDex`.
5.  The LP (Liquidity Provider) tokens are sent to the original `creator` of the coin.

#### **Dapp Integration After Graduation**

-   **Detection:** Your Dapp must monitor the `hasGraduated` boolean variable on the `CarbonCoin` contract. Once `true`, the Dapp should change its UI. The `Graduated` event is also emitted.
-   **UI Change:** The Dapp should replace its native "buy/sell" interface with a link or widget that directs users to the token's trading page on the DEX. The address of the new DEX pair can be found in the `Graduated` event or by calling `dexPair()` on the `CarbonCoinDex` contract (if exposed).
-   **Trading:** All future trades happen on the DEX, not the `CarbonCoin` contract.

## 5. `CarbonOpus` - The Music NFT Marketplace

The `CarbonOpus` contract is an ERC-1155 NFT marketplace designed for artists to sell their music. It uses a USDC token for all payment and reward transactions and a `memberId` system to track artists and their creations independent of their current wallet address.

### Key Purpose

-   To allow artists to mint their music as NFTs. **Minting is restricted to the platform controller** (on behalf of the artist).
-   To enable public users to purchase these music NFTs using USDC.
-   To distribute royalties from sales to artists and referrers in USDC.
-   To collect a protocol fee on each transaction in USDC.

### Dapp Integration: Minting and Purchasing Music

#### **Creating a Song (Restricted Mint)**

New songs are created via the `createMusic` function. **This function is restricted to the contract's `controller`**. In the CarbonOpus platform, when an artist uploads a song, the platform (acting as the controller) calls this function to mint the NFT to the artist's address.

```solidity
function createMusic(bytes32 memberId, address memberAddress, uint256 price, uint256 referralPct) external;
```

-   **Parameters:**
    -   `memberId`: The artist's unique identifier (managed by the platform).

-   To centralize and manage protection features across multiple `CarbonCoin` tokens.
-   To prevent front-running, price manipulation, and bot activities.
-   To provide emergency measures during extreme market volatility.

### Dapp Integration

Dapps should integrate with `CarbonCoinProtection` by calling its view functions to get status information (e.g., `getCircuitBreakerStatus`, `getWhaleIntent`, `getUserCooldown`) and handling reverts from `CarbonCoin`'s buy/sell functions which indicate that `CarbonCoinProtection` has flagged a trade (e.g., `WhaleIntentRequired`).

    -   `newLauncher`: The address of the new `CarbonCoinLauncher` contract.
    -   `timestamp`: The timestamp of the update.

## 7. `CarbonCoinConfig` - The Configuration Store

This contract holds the default configuration parameters for new `CarbonCoin` tokens, including fee structures, anti-bot settings, circuit breaker thresholds, and whale trading limits.

### Key Purpose

-   To provide a centralized and upgradeable source of configuration for `CarbonCoin` tokens.
-   To allow the owner to adjust critical parameters for new token launches.

### Dapp Integration

Dapps can query the view functions of `CarbonCoinConfig` to retrieve the current default settings for various protection mechanisms and fees.

#### **Events**

Dapps should monitor the following event for updates to the default configurations:

-   `DefaultConfigUpdated(string indexed configType, uint256 timestamp)`: Emitted when any of the default configuration types (e.g., "Dex", "Fee", "AntiBot", "CircuitBreaker", "WhaleLimit") are updated.
    -   `configType`: A string indicating which configuration type was updated.
    -   `timestamp`: The timestamp of the update.

## 8. `PermitAndTransfer` - The Utility Contract

This is a utility contract designed to facilitate gasless token transfers using EIP-2612 `permit` signatures followed by a `transferFrom` call.

### Key Purpose

-   To allow users to authorize and transfer ERC-20 tokens (that support EIP-2612 `permit`) in a single transaction, potentially saving gas costs or enabling certain interaction flows.

### Dapp Integration

Dapps can interact with this contract to initiate `permitAndTransfer` operations, where a user signs an off-chain message to approve token spending, and then a third party (or the Dapp itself) can execute the transfer without the user needing to send a separate approval transaction.

#### **Events**

Dapps should monitor the following event for successful `permitAndTransfer` operations:

-   `PermitTransfer(bytes32 indexed senderId, address indexed token, address owner, address spender, uint256 value, bytes32 uuid)`: Emitted after a successful `permit` and `transferFrom` sequence.
    -   `senderId`: An identifier for the sender, useful for filtering events.
    -   `token`: The address of the ERC-20 token being transferred.
    -   `owner`: The address of the token owner who signed the permit.
    -   `spender`: The address of the spender (this contract).
    -   `value`: The amount of tokens transferred.
    -   `uuid`: A unique identifier for matching to a specific order or transaction.
