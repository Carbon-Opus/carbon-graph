# Gemini Code Assistant Project Context

This document provides context for the Gemini Code Assistant to understand the structure and conventions of the CarbonOpus dApp codebase.

## Project Overview

### The Problem We're Solving
Right now, the music industry is broken for independent artists:
Spotify pays artists $0.003 per stream (you need 300,000+ streams just to make minimum wage)
Artists keep only 15-30% of their streaming revenue while middlemen take the rest
12 million independent artists worldwide are struggling to monetize their passion
Fans have no way to financially benefit from discovering and sharing great music early
We're changing that.

### What We're Building
An all-in-one social music platform that empowers independent artists to take control of their careers and rewards fans for being part of the journey.

### For Artists:
Upload music and set your own prices - no middlemen, no gatekeepers
Keep 84-99% of all sales (we only take 1%)
Launch your own creator token - let fans invest in your future success
AI-powered content creation - auto-generate posts, captions, and social content
Cross-platform posting - automatically share to Instagram, Twitter, TikTok, etc.
Own your audience - direct relationship with your fans

### For Fans:
Buy music and truly own it - not rent it like on streaming platforms
Earn money by sharing - when you share a song and someone buys it, you get paid (artist sets the %)
Invest in artists you believe in - buy creator tokens and profit as artists grow
Support artists directly - your money goes straight to the creator
Discover new music in a vibrant social feed

### How the Magic Happens:
Artist uploads a track and sets the price (say, $1)
Fan buys the track for $1 and gets full ownership
Fan shares with friends who also love it
Friends buy the track and the original fan earns 15% of each sale
Artist gets 84%, fan gets 15%, we get 1%
Everyone wins - and music spreads virally because fans are incentivized to share
This creates a viral growth loop where the better the music, the more people share it, the more everyone earns.

### Current Status
We've been heads-down building for months and we're almost there:
MVP is 95% complete - launching publicly in 60 days
Core features working: Upload, purchase, social feed, fan resale rewards
Payment processing integrated - ready for real transactions
AI content tools live - helping artists create and schedule posts
Smart contracts developed - for creator tokens (awaiting audit)
20+ beta testers giving us amazing feedback and validation
The reception from independent artists has been incredible. They're hungry for an alternative to exploitative streaming platforms.

### What Makes Us Different
There are other music platforms out there, but none combine: ✅ Direct artist sales (84-99% revenue share)
 ✅ Fan financial rewards for sharing (viral growth mechanic)
 ✅ Creator tokenization (fans invest in artist success)
 ✅ AI-powered tools (content creation & automation)
 ✅ Social-first experience (discovery + community)
 ✅ Cross-platform integration (post everywhere from one place)
We're not just building another streaming service. We're building the platform where independent artists launch their careers, build real fan communities, and actually make money from their art.

### Our Vision
We believe every independent artist should be able to make a living doing what they love.
We believe fans should profit from discovering great artists early.
We believe music should bring people together, not just extract value from them.
Right now, the music industry makes billions while artists struggle. We're flipping that model on its head.



# CarbonOpus Contracts (`CarbonCoinLauncher`, `CarbonCoin`, & `CarbonOpus`)

This document provides context for interacting with the CarbonOpus smart contracts, specifically `CarbonCoinLauncher`, `CarbonCoin`, and `CarbonOpus`. It is intended for Dapp developers and as a reference for understanding the system's mechanics.

## 1. Overview

The CarbonOpus system is a two-part ecosystem for launching and trading new tokens, often called "memecoins":

1.  **`CarbonCoinLauncher.sol`**: A factory contract that allows anyone to create their own `CarbonCoin` token for a small fee.
2.  **`CarbonCoin.sol`**: The token contract itself. Each token operates on a bonding curve for initial price discovery and trading. Once it gains enough traction (liquidity), it "graduates" by migrating its liquidity to a decentralized exchange (DEX).
3.  **`CarbonOpus.sol`**: An ERC-1155 NFT contract for minting and buying music.

---

## 2. `CarbonCoinLauncher` - The Factory

The `CarbonCoinLauncher` is the entry point for creating new tokens.

### Key Purpose

-   To allow any user to deploy a new `CarbonCoin` token with a custom name, symbol, and bonding curve configuration.
-   To act as a registry for all tokens created through it.
-   To collect a fee for each token creation.

### Dapp Integration: Creating and Discovering Tokens

#### **Creating a Token**

A user can create a new token by calling the `createToken` function:

```solidity
function createToken(
  string memory name,
  string memory symbol,
  ICarbonCoin.BondingCurveConfig memory curveConfig
) public payable returns (address);
```

-   **Parameters:**
    -   `name`: The desired name of the token (e.g., "My Awesome Coin").
    -   `symbol`: The token's symbol (e.g., "MAC").
    -   `curveConfig`: A struct defining the bonding curve's initial parameters:
        -   `virtualEth`: The virtual ETH reserve, which helps set the initial price.
        -   `virtualTokens`: The virtual token supply, also for setting the initial price.
        -   `maxSupply`: The total possible supply of the token.
        -   `graduationThreshold`: The amount of ETH reserves required in the bonding curve to trigger graduation to a DEX.
-   **Value:** The caller must send ETH equal to the `creationFee`.
-   **Returns:** The address of the newly deployed `CarbonCoin` contract.

#### **Discovering Tokens**

To display a list of tokens, a Dapp should listen for the `TokenCreated` event:

```solidity
event TokenCreated(
    address indexed tokenAddress,
    address indexed creator,
    string name,
    string symbol,
    uint256 createdAt,
    uint256 feePaid
);
```

By subscribing to this event, a Dapp can maintain an up-to-date list of all tokens launched through the platform.

#### **Other Useful Functions**

-   `getStats()`: Returns platform-wide statistics like total tokens created and fees collected.
-   `tokens(address tokenAddress)`: Returns `TokenInfo` for a specific token.

---

## 3. `CarbonCoin` - The Token

Each `CarbonCoin` contract has a two-phase lifecycle.

### Phase 1: Bonding Curve Trading (Pre-Graduation)

In this initial phase, all buying and selling occurs directly with the contract. The price is determined algorithmically by a bonding curve.

#### **Buying and Selling**

-   **To Buy:** A user calls `buy(uint256 minTokensOut)` and sends ETH. The contract calculates the number of tokens they receive based on the current price and a buy fee. `minTokensOut` is a slippage parameter.
-   **To Sell:** A user first approves the contract to spend their tokens, then calls `sell(uint256 tokensIn, uint256 minEthOut)`. The contract calculates the ETH returned based on the current price and a sell fee. `minEthOut` is a slippage parameter.

#### **Price Calculations**

Your Dapp should use these view functions to estimate trades for users:

-   `getCurrentPrice()`: Returns the current instantaneous price of 1 token in ETH.
-   `calculateTokensOut(uint256 ethIn)`: Calculates how many tokens a user will get for a given amount of ETH.
-   `calculateEthOut(uint256 tokensIn)`: Calculates how much ETH a user will get for selling a given amount of tokens.

#### **Built-in Protections (Important for Dapp UX)**

The contract has several protection mechanisms a Dapp must be aware of to provide a good user experience.

**1. Anti-Bot Measures:**
-   Users have a cooldown period between buys (`getUserCooldown`). Your UI should reflect this.
-   There are limits on buy amounts in the first few minutes after launch (`getAntiBotInfo`).

**2. Whale Protection (Intent-to-Trade):**
Large trades (both buys and sells) that exceed the `whaleThreshold` require a two-step process to prevent price manipulation.

-   **Step 1: Register Intent:**
    -   The user attempts a large trade by calling `buy` or `sell`.
    -   The transaction will **revert** with a `WhaleIntentRequired` error. This is expected.
    -   The Dapp should catch this, and immediately call the **same function again** with the **same parameters**. This second call registers the user's "intent to trade" and will also revert, but this time with a `WhaleIntentNotReady` error.
-   **Step 2: Execute Trade:**
    -   The user must now wait for a cooldown period (`whaleDelay`). The Dapp can query `getWhaleIntent(address)` to see the status and when the trade can be executed.
    -   After the delay, the user calls the **same `buy` or `sell` function a third time** with the exact same parameters. This will finally execute the trade.

Your Dapp's UI must guide the user through this "register, wait, execute" flow for large trades.

**3. Circuit Breaker:**
-   Trading can be automatically halted if the system detects extreme volatility or a high-impact trade.
-   Use `getCircuitBreakerStatus()` to check if trading is paused and for how long. Your UI should disable trading and inform the user if the circuit breaker is active.

#### **Key View Functions for a Dapp UI**

-   `getReserves()`: Get the current state of the bonding curve reserves.
-   `getTradeLimits()`: Get current trade size limits and whale thresholds.
-   `getAntiBotInfo()`: Get status of anti-bot measures.
-   `getUserCooldown(address)`: Check the remaining buy cooldown for a user.
-   `getCircuitBreakerStatus()`: Check if trading is paused.
-   `getWhaleIntent(address)`: Check a user's pending whale trade intent.

### Phase 2: Graduation & DEX Trading

When the contract's ETH balance (`realEthReserves`) reaches the `GRADUATION_THRESHOLD`, it automatically "graduates".

#### **What Happens During Graduation?**

1.  The `_graduate()` function is triggered.
2.  The `buy()` and `sell()` functions on the `CarbonCoin` contract are permanently disabled.
3.  The contract mints its remaining token supply.
4.  It takes all the ETH it holds and all the newly minted tokens and adds them as a liquidity pair on the designated DEX (e.g., Somnia Exchange).
5.  The LP (Liquidity Provider) tokens are sent to the original `creator` of the coin.

#### **Dapp Integration After Graduation**

-   **Detection:** Your Dapp must monitor the `hasGraduated` boolean variable on the `CarbonCoin` contract. Once `true`, the Dapp should change its UI. The `Graduated` event is also emitted.
-   **UI Change:** The Dapp should replace its native "buy/sell" interface with a link or widget that directs users to the token's trading page on the DEX. The address of the new DEX pair can be found in the `Graduated` event or by calling `dexPair()` on the `CarbonCoin` contract.
-   **Trading:** All future trades happen on the DEX, not the `CarbonCoin` contract.

## 4. `CarbonOpus` - The Music NFT Marketplace

The `CarbonOpus` contract is an ERC-1155 NFT marketplace designed for artists to sell their music. It now uses a USDC token for all payment and reward transactions and a `memberId` system to track artists and their creations.

### Key Purpose

-   To allow artists to mint their music as NFTs, tracked via a `memberId`.
-   To enable users to purchase these music NFTs using USDC.
-   To distribute royalties from sales to artists and referrers in USDC.
-   To collect a protocol fee on each transaction in USDC.

### Dapp Integration: Minting and Purchasing Music

#### **Creating a Song (for Artists)**

A controller can create a new song NFT for an artist by calling `createMusic`:

```solidity
function createMusic(bytes32 memberId, address memberAddress, uint256 price, uint256 referralPct) external;
```

-   **Parameters:**
    -   `memberId`: The artist's unique identifier.
    -   `memberAddress`: The artist's wallet address.
    -   `price`: The price in USDC for one edition of the song.
    -   `referralPct`: The percentage of the sale price (in basis points) that will be given to a referrer.
-   **Note:** This function can only be called by the contract's `controller`.
-   **Event:** The `SongCreated` event is emitted, which a Dapp can use to track new songs.

#### **Purchasing a Song**

A user can purchase a song NFT by calling `purchaseMusic`:

```solidity
function purchaseMusic(bytes32 memberId, address memberAddress, uint256 tokenId, bytes32 referrer) external;
```

-   **Parameters:**
    -   `memberId`: The buyer's unique identifier.
    -   `memberAddress`: The buyer's wallet address.
    -   `tokenId`: The ID of the song to purchase.
    -   `referrer`: An optional `memberId` of a user who referred the sale.
-   **Note:** The caller must have approved the `CarbonOpus` contract to spend the required amount of USDC tokens.
-   **Events:**
    -   `SongPurchased`: Indicates a successful purchase.
    -   `RewardsDistributed`: Details how the payment was split between the artist, referrer, and protocol.

#### **Batch Purchasing**

Users can buy multiple songs in one transaction using `purchaseBatch`:

```solidity
function purchaseBatch(bytes32 memberId, address memberAddress, uint256[] memory tokenIds, bytes32[] memory referrers) external;
```

### Managing Songs and Rewards

#### **For Artists:**

-   `updateSongPrice(uint256 tokenId, uint256 newPrice)`: Allows an artist to change the price of their song in USDC.
-   `updateSongReferralPct(uint256 tokenId, uint256 newPct)`: Allows an artist to change the referral percentage.

#### **For All Users:**

-   `claimRewards(bytes32 memberId)`: Allows any user (artist or referrer) to withdraw their accumulated USDC rewards.
-   `rewards(bytes32 memberId)`: A public mapping to check a user's claimable rewards.
-   `musicBalance(bytes32 memberId)`: Returns the token IDs and balances of songs owned by a user.

### Administrative Functions

These functions are restricted to the contract owner or a designated manager:

-   `updateProtocolFee(uint256 newFee)`: Change the protocol fee.
-   `updateTreasury(address newTreasury)`: Change the address where protocol fees are sent.
-   `updateController(address newController)`: Transfer the `controller` role.
-   `scaleSongPrice(uint256 tokenId, uint256 newPrice)`: A privileged function for the `controller` to update a song's price.
-   `setURI(string memory newUri)`: Update the base URI for the token metadata.

### Tokenomics and Fees

-   **Protocol Fee:** A percentage of every sale is sent to the treasury. The fee is set by `protocolFee` (in basis points).
-   **Referral Fee:** A percentage of the sale, set by the artist, is awarded to a referrer.
-   **Artist's Share:** The remainder of the sale price goes to the artist.

### Constructor

```solidity
constructor(string memory uri, address usdcTokenAddress) public;
```

-   **Parameters:**
    -   `uri`: The base URI for the token metadata.
    -   `usdcTokenAddress`: The address of the USDC token contract.
